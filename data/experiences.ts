        To help GreenMobility succeed and continue to scale, I took on a new role as CTO. As CTO, I developed and executed our technical strategy, aligned our technology solutions with business objectives, identified new opportunities for growth, and created a culture of innovation and collaboration. This transition allowed me to take on a more strategic role in driving our company's success, while still leveraging my technical expertise to guide the development of innovative solutions.

I've had the opportunity to organize a number of impactful workshops and events, showing folks firsthand how these tools can transform their businesses.
\n
      One event that stands out in my mind is Cloudfest.dk in Copenhagen. This was an amazing gathering of cloud enthusiasts and experts from all over, where we shared insights, best practices, and real-world case studies of how to make the most of Cloud Native and Google Cloud. Overall, I'm dedicated to spreading the word about cloud tech and empowering more companies to embrace these cutting-edge tools.

          As Engineering Manager for Semler Connected Cars, I was given the opportunity to focus my efforts on building out the platform and scaling the company to new solutions. In this role, I was responsible for hiring and interviewing all new technical hires, and for setting up the technical infrastructure that would allow the company to grow and expand its offerings.

With my help, Semler Connected Cars was able to develop a highly skilled technical team that was able to take the platform to the next level. Together, we tackled complex technical challenges and built out new features and capabilities that enabled Semler to deliver even greater value to its customers and partners. Through it all, I remained passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies and innovative engineering practices to build better, more impactful solutions.

        description: `
          As the first technical hire for Semler Connected Cars, I played an instrumental role in co-founding and building a powerful platform that successfully onboarded over 150,000 IoT devices. In addition to developing a custom app that was skinned for all four of Semler's major brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, Seat, and Skoda, I also led the technical decisions and strategies for the platform.

One of the most exciting features of the platform was its ability to notify both customers and workshops in real-time when something was wrong with a vehicle. For example, during demos we would remove a cable from a car engine, and the platform would immediately detect the issue and send notifications to both the customer and the workshop. This was a game-changer in terms of enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime for both vehicle owners and mechanics.

Overall, as a co-founder and key technical leader, I'm proud to have played a critical role in developing this innovative Connected Cars solution that delivered real value to Semler's customers and partners.
