# Visiting Prague and what we saw

We just spent a good week visiting Prague, it is a beautiful city with a lot of charm. The old city is interesting to discover and has many things within walking distance.

## Places we visited

### Národní Muzeum

Interesting nature museum highlighting all kinds of aspects of nature and prehistoric. Has really interesting displays and scaled up models of insects. You can also visit the dome at the top for a spectacular view of the city.

### Franz Kafka - Rotating Head

A mesmerizing statue that moves a head to point in a different direction, it has layers and moves them independently.

### Museum of Communism

The Czech Republic have been caught in the middle between the West and East, capitalism and communism on each side. The museum is really great at telling the story from the Czech Republic side which is often untold in the great communism debates or history tellings.

Pro: Tells the story with a clear direction, you can read all the text in 2 hours

Cons: Lot of text, not so much to look at (so you should like to read if you visit), the English text contains unnecessary convoluted words instead of more basic words

### Christmas Markets

The city has a high number of cozy Christmas markets around the city. They consist of many small stalls. One downside is they often sell much of the same or sells Gløgg wine. Overall fun to visit and walk around.

### Charles Bridge

Famous and a bit crowded, but the view from the bridge is interesting. You can see many beautiful statues along the bridge and the water flowing through a city.

### Aquapalace

We chose to go to Prague instead of a beach holiday, but we still wanted to be near a big pool. I had seen Aquapalace in my searches for pools in Prague so we decided to visit one of the days. The place is really big and we were fortunate to visit a weekday afternoon where the place were basically empty. The place is really big but feels compact with things to try everywhere.

I like to swim but this is one of the crazier places I have tried. The water slides are quite strong, the currents on some of the swim paths really strong, this does make for some exciting and thrilling experience, but it feels like it would never be allowed in Denmark, take it however you want.

Overall a really positive experience, but also a bit expensive. Entrance was 1,100 krona per person (about 45 €), which for a swimming pool is expensive, but for a resort visit is kind of cheap. You can buy food and drinks in various places inside and many different pool types for both children and adults. Would go again. We spent 3 hours there and it felt suitable.

## Places we ate

### Nostress Bakery Vězeňská

We visited many bakeries and this one was the best. Had really good pastries, cakes, toasts, focaccia breads and coffees.

### Mistral Cafe

The most fancy cafe we visited, with neon signs and blogger plants. 

### Pizza Nuova

Really nice Italian restaurant that can serve many people but still feels cozy. Had a small children play area that however could need some renewal.
