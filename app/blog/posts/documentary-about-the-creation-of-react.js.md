# Documentary about the creation of React.js

Watching this documentary brings up a lot of fun memories, it was as crazy as they talked about and the people in it are also really likeable, I think that is also visible. Dan Abramov, Christopher “_vjuex_” Chedeau, Sophie Alpert, Pete Hunt. Watch it if you want to see how React.js really felt at the start and not just how it feels today as all we only does 😄
