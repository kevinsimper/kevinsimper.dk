# All ChatGPT clone interfaces could do better

It is funny how every AI company has copied ChatGPT interface (Claude, Deepseek, Mistral, all history on the left, a small text box in the middle and a conversation interface once you begin writing. It is boring.

Here is what I would suggest doing better:

### Favorite conversation

Make it possible to favorit certain conversations, some conversations you want to come back to.

### Summarize at the top

 Some conversations get awful long.

### Categorize my conversations 

If it is just a quick question, then having it fill out the conversation history does not make sense. Categorize my conversations into buckets like, "Quick questions", "Long conversations", "Upvoted", "Downvoted". Hide Quick Questions and downvoted from the history.

### Combine multiple conversations 

As we are beginning to be more advance users, we know that ChatGPT are limited in a single conversations.
Allow me to summarize two or more conversations.

### Suggest subconversations

If ChatGPT detect that multiple conversations are better, it should suggest starting a new one for that questions.

### When starting a new conversation, see if there is a similar first to continue

Starting a agent conversation from scratch is hard as you have to regive it all the context. ChatGPT should make it easier to find and continue a conversation.

### Allow control of context

When I start a new conversation, ask if it should begin from the global knowledge about you, based on all conversations or it should start from scratch. 

### CustomGPT != Style

A custom GPT should not be needed to get a specific style, it should be controlled. And it should not have to send a message that it should write it shorter or match a specific style. Claude has this, but it is still rudimental.

### Show me prediction before submitting

Predict what writing style I want and show. Who do I have to submit before seeing an answer?

### Crawl URL and show output

If you give a URL it is too random what happens, most time it says it can't get it, sometimes it guesses just based on the URL as a text, sometimes it fetches the page. It should be much simpler.

### Index a website

Let me give a URL that it indexes and I can ask any question.

### Multiplayer

Make it possible to have two people talk to the same agent, I want a conversation together with my wife where it keeps track of our vacation plans, another for daily purchases, another for mealplanning for the week.
