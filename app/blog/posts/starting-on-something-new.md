# Starting on something new

I quit my job recently because I wanted to start something new, jump into the unknown.

It can feel scary to start something new, how is it going to end, what are the next steps. I have been comfortable with not always knowing the way, I have multiple times had times where I worked on my own thing or did something else.

This time it feels different however, having a small daughter makes your schedule not your own and I really enjoy spending time with her. But it has made my time even more valuable, before I could have work and still have time for my own ideas in the evening/night, now my time is spent on work and my family.

I also tried starting my own startup 10 years ago, back then the naivety brought me forward. Now 10 years later the knowledge of what is hard has nearly held me back. You can come up with 100 things that have to be done, nearly killing the momentum before you even get started.

I have also learnt what persistence is and been close to people that have persisted and it has brought fruit. I can not be a little bit envious, but I have even bigger respect because it is the persistence that brought them what they got.

That is what I will do, here is to the next 10 years of persistence.
