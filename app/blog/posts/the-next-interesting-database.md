# The next interesting database

From the early days I have been fasinated by Firebase, but the lack of schema/structure, fuzzy searching and sum/count queries has always kept me away for serious projects.

But Xata.io looks to solve that problem. It has schema, schema and search. It also have interesting pricing, but I guess as always it is to attract new developers.

You get 15 GB of space for free, and next pricing step is $8, so very reasonable.

Planetscale.com is also interesting, and is supported by Prisma.

I find these databases much more interesting than Hasura which seems to force you down a specific road. They also seems better than Contentful and databse alikes which seems more focused on CMS data.
