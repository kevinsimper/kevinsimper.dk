# AI is bad a coding AI

I don't think we will see the exponitial boost from AI before AI can code itself.

AI is incredible useful, it is incredible at writing a lot of code with high accuracy, but when you use AI to code with, it gets the basic things incorrect. 

I totally get that it does not know every library out there and every codebase, but it does not even know its own APIs.

Most AI's are hosted since that is both technically and economically feasible, so you call it through an API.

Then most things the AI can do is that it returns some functions it want you to execute on its behalf and report back if it was successful and it will decides its next actions.

AI has become really good at this function calling, but it still forgets when it programs AI that AI's now typically can call multiple functions in one turn which leads to mistake.

And it is often the user that has to tell it made that mistake 😅
