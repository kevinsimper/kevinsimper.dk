# Sim Card with data when visiting San Francisco

It is so common to have a data connection on your phone anywhere you are now that being without a internet connection feels weird. Most mobile providers in Denmark gives free data to all European countries, even the cheapest plans gives you 4 GB data in all of Europe for only 13 usd per month.

So what do you do to get data in USA. There is the option of getting a 3.dk mobile provider plan, their latest prices has been lowered a lot just in the last half year, now you can a plan that includes data in USA for only 130 kroner or what is 20 usd! <https://www.3.dk/abonnementer/> It is a incredible deal (it used to be 220 kroner or 33 usb). Let go into what kind of deal you can get in USA.

If you don't have 3.dk or didn't get to buy a simcard before you boarded the planen, you have 2 options, either AT&T or T-Mobile. I choose Tmobile and they have a special plan for Turists that only last 1 month and is prepaid. It is difficult to find on the website, but you can get two plans:

2 GB for 30 USD <https://prepaid.t-mobile.com/prepaid-international-tourist-plan> 

They don't advertise this plan in the shops, because it is a much lower plan, but can be more than suffient for getting around and ordering Uber's.

10 GB for 40 USD without tax, (44 usd including tax!) <https://prepaid.t-mobile.com/simply-prepaid>

Unlimited for 50 USD

### Conclusion

It is freaking expensive to get data plan in USA, (much better deal buy a danish sim card if you can! ðŸ˜‰)
