# Building a newsletter for bid managers

I am learning a lot about bid management, and also trying to follow the industry what is going on. I have started a small newsletter for bid managers where I write about new jobs that are being posted.

You can see the site here, [bidmanager.dk](https://bidmanager.dk/)

By following the job posts you can also gauge what is going on in the industry, what are the expectations to bid managers and maybe also what is the salary for good bid managers.
Like are they expected to know AI or ChatGPT? What other tools are you expected to now.

I was a thining a bit if it was weird that I made a website like that because I am also making a startup called [Herkules.dk](https://herkules.dk/) which helps bid managers, but if I am honest and trying to give value then I thought it make sense. I am genuinely trying to have more bid managers in Denmark since I believe that Denmark has a lot to offer to other european countries, and that requires more bid managers in danish companies.
