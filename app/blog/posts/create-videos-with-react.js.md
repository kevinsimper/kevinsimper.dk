# Create videos with React.js

I have been making videos with Adobe Premiere and dabbled with After Effects for few animations, but it is so far from coding and requires a lot of knowledge.

I have made GreenMobility Wrapped as a website where I have used Puppeteer.js to take a screenshot. Last years edition I did think of making it an animation by simple taking multiple screenshots of putting them together in a small gif.

Or I could have use this seemly very cool project https://www.remotion.dev/

Making videos with React is such a genius move. They can simply control the animations by manually progressing the state of the react components and then take a screenshot for each. They also made a cool editor where you can easier visualize it and as a way to finance the project, smart!
