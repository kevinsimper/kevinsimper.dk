# Making Defencetech more visible with AI

I am making a new website in denmark that helps highlight companies in danish defencetech. 

I was visiting the danish Dalo Days in Ballerup. DALO is the Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organsation in Denmark. I was held on the 20th and 21st August and it was pretty incredible seeing all companies selling and trying to sell the danish defence. There were around 800 companies exhibiting.

FMI (Forsvarsministeriets Materiel- og Indk√∏bsstyrelse) is a huge organization and each year publish a document of what they are looking to buy. For 2025 they published a report you can see here, and for just IT which was the shortest section, they were looking to aquire for estimated 154 to 354 million Danish kroner.

But there is quite some inefficiencies, firstly the DALO Days conference, all the exhibitiors were published as a 84 pages PDF with just company name, country, 2 sentence description and stand number. 
I wish to buy something smarter, something that connects companies with AI. Here is my ideas for how to make it smarter:

- AI Search - It should be possible to search all exhibitors for DALO Days 2026 with semantic queries 
- Search their websites - It should be possible to search all the websites of the exhibitors 
- See who were exhibiting last year of the ones that also showed last year
- Fetch all their financial information
- List all relevant people to the companies
- See which of the companies has won Defence contracts the prior years

So hopefully it will be a lot of interesting data crunching for [DALO Days 2026](https://defencetech.dk/events/dalo-days-2026)! Reach out if you want access to all the data and do your own research.

You can also see the website called [defencetech.dk](https://defencetech.dk/)
