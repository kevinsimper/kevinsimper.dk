# Google Cloud Kubernetes workshop - Things to prepare checklist

Here is what will be good to have prepared on your computer, it will take you around 15 minutes to do:

### Docker installed on your computer

You can install it by going here: <https://docs.docker.com/install/>

Or you can install it by brew.sh by running: `$ brew cask install docker`

### A GitHub account

This is so that you can store and try out doing continues deployment to Kubernetes

If you are on Windows I can recommend <https://desktop.github.com/>

### A Google Cloud account

You can sign up for a free account on <https://cloud.google.com/> and you have to put in a credit card. Most things will be done on Google Cloud for free or only cost cents. The credit card is for Google to prevent spam.

### A terminal configured with gcloud-cloud-sdk

You can install it here <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/> or with brew.sh running: `$ brew cask install google-cloud-sdk`

You can try to run this two commands to test that it works:

`$ docker run hello-world`

`$ gcloud auth login`

---

If you have those 4 things done, you are ready for tomorrow üëç
