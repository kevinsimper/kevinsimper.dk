# Coffee Places in Copenhagen I recommended

This is just the places of coffee places I can recommend in Copenhagen.

- Kaffeplantagen, Vesterbro

  Simple and calm place with a lot of afternoon soon and tables with enough
  space for a computer, but not a lot of electric outlets.

- The Living Room, Inner Copenhagen

  Really cozy spot in the inner Copenhagen that both have good coffee and cakes,
  but also cocktails. Lots of seating downstairs.

- Bevar's, Nørrebro

  A great coffee that also serves wine on a sideroad to the busy Nørrebrogade
  and really close to "søerne".

- Snabel B, Valby

  Small coffee place in Valby with great seating and nice outdoor sitting.
