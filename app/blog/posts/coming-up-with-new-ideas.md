# Coming up with new ideas

Be good at coming up with new ideas.

Coming up with new ideas forces you to be creative, thinking of how you can combine things in a new and interesting way.

Improve your ideas by pitching them to other people and hear what they think. By pitching them to others you can often together come up with a new and even better idea than each of you could have done alone. Don’t be afraid to jam.

Do not take it seriously, most ideas are bad.

The more ideas you can come up with, the bigger change that 1 out of 100 ideas is good.

If you don’t have an idea, ask others what problems they have.

An idea can be many things, it can of course be the obvious on how to earn money, but it can be on how to improve a thing, how to help others around you, how to make people happy.

Write your good ideas down so you can look at them later.

Life is not about how you can get a bigger slice of the pie, it is about how we can make more pies so there is more for everyone.

An idea is “a thought or suggestion as to a possible course of action”.

You don’t have to execute on ideas immediately, an idea can be in the back of your head while you do what you normally do. An idea often becomes better when it has been thought through and has had some time to it.

An idea can be something you can improve next time you do a task, you don’t have to go back and change all the things you already have done.

The biggest threat to ideas is the status quo.

Don’t come after others when their idea may not work, it is a sureway to limit their ideas.

Don’t be afraid to pitch big ideas.
